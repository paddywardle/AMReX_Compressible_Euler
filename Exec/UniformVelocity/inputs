# PLOTFILES
# NOTE - VisIt (recommended), Paraview or amrvis are needed to visualise data.  AMReX outputs boxlib format
#        data; see lab CAMReX wiki for instructions on plotting.  Using a base name of plt ensures
#	 visualisation knows the current cycle (iteration) as well as time - see AMReX documentation for more.
